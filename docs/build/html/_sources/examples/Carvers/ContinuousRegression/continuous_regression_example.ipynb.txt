    "## About this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we embark on a journey to elevate the predictive capabilities of the California Housing Prices Dataset through advanced preprocessing using the ``ContinuousCarver`` pipeline. Renowned for its association-maximizing discretization, ``ContinuousCarver`` is a powerful Python tool designed to handle diverse data types—whether they be quantitative or qualitative. Our specific goal is to prepare the dataset for continuous regression tasks, such as predicting housing prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "The California Housing Prices Dataset is a treasure trove of features, encompassing information on factors like square footage, bedrooms, location, and more. By employing ``ContinuousCarver``, we aim to seamlessly discretize both quantitative and qualitative features, tailoring them for optimal representation in our continuous regression models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this notebook, we'll explore the intricacies of ``ContinuousCarver``'s discretization pipeline, witnessing its adaptability to a variety of data types. Whether it involves transforming square footage or encoding location information, ``ContinuousCarver`` ensures that each feature is finely tuned for our regression tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Join us in this exploration as we leverage the power of ``ContinuousCarver`` to preprocess the California Housing Prices Dataset. Through effective feature engineering and discretization, our aim is to create a dataset that captures the nuanced relationships within the housing market, setting the stage for the development of accurate and impactful continuous regression models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's dive in and uncover the potential of ``ContinuousCarver`` in transforming the California Housing Prices Dataset for optimal predictive modeling.\n",
