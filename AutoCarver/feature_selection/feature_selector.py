            Number of features to select.

            List of column names of quantitative features to chose from, by default ``None``

            information on AutoCarver's processing and tables of target rates and frequencies for
            X, by default ``False``

        pretty_print : bool, optional

            Overrides the value of ``verbose``, by default ``False``

        **params
            Sets thresholds for ``measures`` and ``filters``, passed as keyword arguments.

            * thresh_measure, float, minimum association between target and features, by default ``0``. To be used with: ``measure_filter``.
            * name_measure, str, measure to be used for minimum association filtering. To be used with: ``measure_filter``.
            * thresh_nan, float,aximum percentage of NaNs in a feature, by default ``1``. To be used with: ``nans_measure``.
            * thresh_mode, float, maximum percentage of the mode of a feature, by default ``1``. To be used with: ``mode_measure``.
