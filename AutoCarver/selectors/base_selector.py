        Parameters
        ----------
        n_best : int
            Number of features to select.

            * Best features are the ``n_best`` of each provided data types (set in ``quantitative_features`` and/or ``qualitative_features``)
            * Best features are the ``n_best`` for each provided measures (set in ``quantitative_measures`` and/or ``qualitative_measures``)

        quantitative_features : list[str]
            List of column names of quantitative features to chose from, by default ``None``.
            Must be set if ``qualitative_features=None``.

        qualitative_features : list[str]
            List of column names of qualitative features to chose from, by default ``None``.
            Must be set if ``quantitative_features=None``.

        quantitative_measures : list[Callable], optional
            List of association measures to be used for ``quantitative_features``.
            :ref:`Implemented measures <Measures>` are:

            * For association evaluation: :ref:`Kruskal-Wallis' H <kruskal>` (default), :ref:`R`
            * For outlier detection: :ref:`Standard score <zscore>`, :ref:`Interquartile range <iqr>`

        qualitative_measures : list[Callable], optional
            List of association measures to be used for ``qualitative_features``.
            :ref:`Implemented measures <Measures>` are:

            * For association evaluation: :ref:`Pearson's chiÂ² <chi2>`, :ref:`cramerv`, :ref:`tschuprowt` (default)

        quantitative_filters : list[Callable], optional
            List of filters to be used for ``quantitative_features``.
            :ref:`Implemented filters <Filters>` are:

            * For linear correlation: :ref:`pearson_filter`, :ref:`Spearman's rho <spearman_filter>` (default)

            List of filters to be used for ``qualitative_features``.

        colsample : float, optional
            Size of sampled list of features for sped up computation, between 0 and 1, by default ``1.0``
            By default, all features are used.

            For colsample=0.5, FeatureSelector will search for the best features in
            ``features[:len(features)//2]`` and then in ``features[len(features)//2:]``.

            **Tip:** for better performance, should be set such as ``len(features)//2 < 200``.

        verbose : bool, optional
            * ``True``, without IPython installed: prints raw feature selection steps for X, by default ``False``
            * ``True``, with IPython installed: adds HTML tables to the output.

            **Tip**: IPython displaying can be turned off by setting ``pretty_print=False``.

        **kwargs
            Allows one to set thresholds for provided ``quantitative_measures``/``qualitative_measures`` and ``quantitative_filters``/``qualitative_filters`` (see :ref:`Measures` and :ref:`Filters`) passed as keyword arguments.
