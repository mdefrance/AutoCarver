            **Tip:** for better performance, should be set such as ``len(features)//2 < 200``.

        verbose : bool, optional
            * ``True``, without IPython: prints raw selection steps for X, by default ``False``
            * ``True``, with IPython: adds HTML tables to the output.

            **Tip**: IPython displaying can be turned off by setting ``pretty_print=False``.

            ``qualitative_measures`` and ``quantitative_filters``/``qualitative_filters``
