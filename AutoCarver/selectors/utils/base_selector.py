        Keyword Arguments
        -----------------
        measures : list[BaseMeasure], optional
            List of association measures to be used, by default ``None``.

            Selects :attr:`n_best_per_type` features for each measure provided.
            Implemented measures are:

            * :class:`QuantitativeFeature`: see available :ref:`QuantiMeasures`
            * :class:`QualitativeFeature`: see available :ref:`QualiMeasures`

        filters : list[BaseFilter], optional
            List of filters to be used, by default ``None``.
